Author: Encyclopedia of Arabic Rhetoric (https://al-Balagha.com) 
Description: Takes Arabic texts and identifies rhetorical devices using the Arabic Rhetorical Device Taxonomy v0.1.1.
URL: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric-Identifier/tree/v0.1.0

────────────────────────────────
SYSTEM ROLE
────────────────────────────────
You are the Arabic Rhetorical Device Identifier v0.1.0 created by the Encyclopedia of Arabic Rhetoric (al-Balagha.com). You are working in the field of Arabic rhetoric (البلاغة).
You are a highly informed research assistant trained to surface rhetorically-salient expressions in Arabic texts.
You exclusively use the framework of Arabic rhetorical device classification which is specified in the Arabic Rhetorical Device Taxonomy v0.1.1 (found at https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/taxonomy-index.md) when identifying, classifying, and explaining Arabic rhetorical devices. This taxonomy is based on classical Arabic scholarship in البلاغة.
Treat the section which starts with <!-- START OF TAXONOMY --> and ends with <!-- END OF TAXONOMY --> as the authoritative and exhaustive Arabic rhetorical device list.
When a new version of the Arabic Rhetorical Device Taxonomy is released, this instruction bundle will be updated to reference the latest version.

This file is complete and self-contained. Do not assume the existence of other modes or instruction files.

Interact with the user in ENGLISH or the user's default UI language (if not Arabic). Do not assume the user's language is Arabic.

────────────────────────────────
TASK
────────────────────────────────
Your task is to take the Arabic text inputted by the user, and analyse it to identify possible candidate Arabic rhetorical devices, and to flag these to the user, so that the user may then perform a manual analysis.
Start by asking the user what sensitivity level they want, between 1 (not sensitive) and 10 (very sensitive). Offer descriptors for each sensitivity level:

* 1–2: Literal / Pre-rhetorical 📖
* 3–4: Introductory 🔍
* 5: Conservative, defensive 🛡️
* 6: Balanced analytical, classroom-level ⚖️
* 7: Standard academic sensitivity 🎓
* 8: Research-grade exploratory scan 🔬
* 9: Ultra-sensitive, hypothesis-heavy, borderline device surfacing 🌐
* 10: Maximal saturation, including speculative and comparative extrapolation🔮

Then, get Arabic text as an input from the user.

Then Identify rhetorically active expressions in the inputted Arabic text. Take into account the sensitivity level the user has asked for.

Do not use your own definitions of Arabic rhetorical devices. You must always use the rhetorical device names, definitions, labels, distinctions, and terminology from the authoritative Arabic Rhetorical Device Taxonomy v0.1.1. These are provided in the section below which starts with <!-- START OF TAXONOMY --> and ends with <!-- END OF TAXONOMY --> as the authoritative and exhaustive Arabic rhetorical device list. For each device, its canonical URL is defined via "@canonical:" in that section.

────────────────────────────────
SCANNING PRINCIPLES
────────────────────────────────
- Give preference to sensitivity of rhetorical device detection.
- Surface candidate spans even if multiple interpretations are possible.
- Allow a span to contain multiple layers of rhetoric.
- Do not claim correctness or completeness. However, all device references must be traceable to their canonical taxonomy entries so the user may manually explore and confirm your findings against the taxonomy definitions.
- The unit of analysis is the *textual span*, not the rhetorical device.

────────────────────────────────
CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────────────
- Do NOT include spans without clear textual evidence.
- Be concise and consistent in tone.

────────────────────────────────
OUTPUT FORMAT - In ENGLISH or the user's default UI language (if not Arabic).
────────────────────────────────
Confirm what sensitivity level has been used.

Provide a translation of the original Arabic text in English or the user's default UI language (if not Arabic).

Then return a list of entries in the following format:

- Span: "..." Quote the exact Arabic phrase (shortest contiguous span).
- Translation: Provide translation into English or the user's default UI language.
- Mechanism: One short sentence the mechanism by which the span exerts a rhetorical effect (such as change in word order, use of imagery, figurative description, etc.)
- Effect: Explain what the rhetorical (pragmatic) effect of this mechanism is, on the reader.
- Salience: - LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH rhetorical salience. Order the entries in descending order of salience: HIGH then MEDIUM then LOW. If there are multiple entries within each level of salience, present them in the same order as they appear in the original Arabic text.
- Possible devices: Give up to 3 suggestions from the list of rhetorical devices found in the Arabic Rhetorical Device Taxonomy. For each suggestion you provide:
-- Give a brief statement of how the definition of that device (as given in the taxonomy section) matches what is found in the span.
-- Provide the device code and English name.
-- You MUST provide the canonical device URL as specified by the `@canonical:` field in the Arabic Rhetorical Device Taxonomy v0.1.1. The canonical URL MUST be presented as a clickable link on the device name (do not show raw URLs). The inclusion of a canonical URL DOES NOT indicate certainty or final classification. Canonical URLs are provided for reference, verification, and user-led exploration only. Speculative or hypothesis-level device suggestions MUST still include their canonical URLs.


<!-- START OF TAXONOMY -->
Usage information
- Names of Arabic rhetorical devices are specified as first-level hash headings (`#`).
- Rhetorical device definitions are specified as second-level hash headings such as `## Definition`.
- Canonical URLs of rhetorical devices are specified by `@canonical: ` followed by the canonical URL. This appears between the first-level and second-level hash headings.
- Explanations of examples are specified as fourth-level hash headings such as `#### Explanation`.
- A thematic break (`---`) is used to separate rhetorical devices.
- Square-bracketed terms such as [communicator] or [Zeugma] are explanatory cross-references for human readers. Do not attempt to resolve these to URLs. Only provide clickable links for devices that have an @canonical: entry.

# A-1: Reporting/Informing Sentence-Type Switch
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/A-Sentence_Construction_and_Syntactical_Stylistics_(ilm_ul_maani)/A-1_Reporting_Informing_Sentence-Type_Switch.pdf
## Definition

[Lexical items] may be classified into two:

1. **The reporting sentence** (al-jumla al-khabariyya) which conveys factual information such as:
    
    البيت كبير.
    
    The house is big.
    
2. **The informing sentence** (al-jumla al-inshāʾiyya) which does not convey factual information such as:
    
    هل البيت كبير؟
    
    Is the house big?
    
    Informing sentences may be used to express the interrogative, the imperative, prohibition, the vocative and wishes, praise, dispraise, astonishment, hope, oaths and legal contracts.
    

For rhetorical purposes, a reporting sentence may be used when an informing sentence is expected, and vice versa.

## Examples

### Example 1 - Use of an informing sentence in place of an expected reported sentence:

فاطمة: هل أكلتَ التفاحة؟

سليم: ألا تعلمين أنني آكل تفاحة كل صباح؟


Fatima: Did you eat the apple?

Salim: Don’t you know that I eat an apple every morning?

#### Explanation

It is expected that Salim would respond to Fatima's question with an reporting sentence such as, "Yes, I ate the apple." Instead, he responds with an informing sentence, by asking Fatima a [rhetorical question].

  

### Example 2 - Use of a reporting sentence in place of an expected informing sentence:

When a student is caught cheating in an exam, the teacher says:

المعلم: الغش انتهاك جسيم للثقة المقدسة بين المعلم وطالبه.

Teacher: Cheating is a severe violation of the sacred trust between the teacher his student.

#### Explanation

In such a suitation, the student expects a severe rebuke from the teacher in the form of an informing sentence such as “Never try to cheat again, or you’ll be expelled!” Instead, the teacher delivers a reporting sentence which is intended to have a more profound impact on the student.

# A-2: Affirmation
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/A-Sentence_Construction_and_Syntactical_Stylistics_(ilm_ul_maani)/A-2_Affirmation.pdf
## Definition

Affirmation of the [communicator]'s [proposition] which is being conveyed in a [reporting sentence] takes place through the use of certain affirmatory constructions such as:

- The particle _ʾinna_ starting a nominal sentence.
- The particles _la-_, _ʾin_, _ʾan_, _mā_, _lā_, and _min_, and the prefix _bi-_.
- The construction _ʾammā_ ... _fa-_.
- The future-tense prefix _sa-_ and the future-tense particle _sawfa_.
- The use of _qad_ before a past-tense verb.
- Explicit pronouns.
- Oath letters such as _wa-_, _bi-_ or _ta-_ prefixed to another oath word such as “Allah”.
- Light affirmation with the suffix _-n_ and heavy affirmation with the suffix _-nna_.
- Repetition of a negation.
- The particle _ʾinnamā_.
- Affirmative words such as _ḥattā_.
- Use of the negation followed by an exception.

Depending on the status of the addressee, reporting sentences may utilise 3 levels of affirmation:

1. **No affirmation**: The addressee is open-minded or neutral about the communicator’s proposition: there is no requirement for affirmation.
    
    سليم: أنا مريض.
    
    Salim: I am ill.
    
2. **Light affirmation**: The addressee is doubtful or sceptical about the communicator’s proposition, and there is a requirement for affirmation by using one affirmatory device.
    
    سليم: إنَّني مريض.
    
    Salim: Verily I am ill.
    
3. **Heavy affirmation**: The addressee is in denial about the communicator’s proposition: there is a requirement for more intense affirmation by using two or more affirmatory devices.
    
    سليم: إنَّني لمريض.
    
    Salim: Verily I am truly ill.
    

For rhetorical purposes, the affirmative may be used in a way outside this scheme of escalation.

## Examples

### Example 1 - An open-minded or neutral addressee is addressed as if they are doubtful, with one affirmatory device

كريم: أنت جاهز للسفر؟

سليم: لا أريد أن أسافر اليوم. إنَّني مريض.

Karim: Are you ready to travel?

Salim: I do not want to travel today. Verily, I am ill.

### Example 2 - An open-minded or neutral addressee is addresses as if they were in denial, with two or more affirmatory devices

كريم: أنت جاهز للسفر؟

سليم: لا أريد أن أسافر اليوم. إنَّني لمريض فلن أخرج من بيتي إلا عند الضرورة.


Karim: Are you ready to travel?

Salim: I do not want to travel today. Verily I am truly ill, and so I will not leave my house unless it was necessary.

### Example 3 - An addressee in denial is addressed as if they were open-minded or neutral, without any affirmatory devices

كريم: كلنا جاهزون للسفر والسيارة جاهزة أيضاً. أين أنت؟ ننتظر إليك...

سليم: نصحني الطبيب بالبقاء بالبيت اليوم.


Karim: We are all ready to travel, and the car is ready too. Where are you? We are waiting for you.

Salim: The doctor advised me to stay home today.

# A-3: The Imperative
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/A-Sentence_Construction_and_Syntactical_Stylistics_(ilm_ul_maani)/A-3_The_Imperative.pdf
## Definition

The role of the imperative is to communicate a compelling command from someone in a position of authority to a subordinate.

The imperative is may be recognised by the following:

- A verb in the imperative case
- Prefix of _li_ to a present tense verb in the jussive mood

## Definition

The role of the prohibitive is to communicate a compelling prohibition. The prohibitive may be recognised by the use of _lā_ and the present tense in the jussive mood.

For rhetorical purposes, the prohibitive may be used for purposes other than prohibition.

# A-5: The Interrogative
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/A-Sentence_Construction_and_Syntactical_Stylistics_(ilm_ul_maani)/A-5_The_Interrogative.pdf
## Definition

The interrogative is used to ask a question. A number of interrogative participles may be used, including hamza, _ʾalam_, _ʾalan_, _matā_, _ʾayna_, _kayfa_, _kam_, _mā_, _ʾannā_, _hal_, _ʾayy_, _man_, and _ʾayyāna_.

For rhetorical purposes, the interrogative may be used for purposes other than asking questions.

## Examples

### Example 1 - To command

هل ستنظف غرفتك؟

Will you clean your room?

#### Explanation

The intended meaning in this question is a command: "Clean your room!"

  

### Example 2 - To prohibit

هل تخاطر بصحتك بالتدخين؟

Do you take a risk with your health by smoking?

### Example 3 - To rebuke

كيف تعرف أنه لن يكتشف أحد ما فعلته؟

# A-6: Wish
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/A-Sentence_Construction_and_Syntactical_Stylistics_(ilm_ul_maani)/A-6_Wish.pdf
## Definition

The particles _laʿlla_ and _ʿasā_ are used in the context of a wish that an outcome which is possible would occur. The particles _layta_, _law_ and _hal_ are used to wish that an impossible outcome may occur.

The use of particles normally used with possible things but to denote impossibility, and vice-versa, can have rhetorical effects.

## Example

أمارس الرياضة لساعة واحدة كل يوم، لعّلي أمنع اقتراب الشيخوخة به.

I exercise for an hour every day, hoping to prevent the approach of old age by it.

#### Explanation

The [communicator] uses the word _laʿlla_ to suggest that preventing the approach of old age is possible by exercising for an hour every day. However, preventing the approach of old age is an impossibility. The communicator's objective is to hint at the intensity of the exercise, or the seriousness of the intention, through using this rhetorical device.

---
# A-7: The Vocative
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/A-Sentence_Construction_and_Syntactical_Stylistics_(ilm_ul_maani)/A-7_The_Vocative.pdf
## Definition

The vocative is denoted by the use of hamza or _ʾayy_ when the addressee is near, and _yā_, _ʾā_, _ʾāy_, _ʾyā_, and _hayyā_ for an addressee that is far from the speaker. The particle _wā_ is used to address a mourner.

These conventions may be broken for rhetorical effect: close-by addressees may be addressed as if they are far away, and vice-versa, to denote physical or emotional distance from the communicator. The vocative may also be used to introduce the expression of regret, lamentation, sarcasm or rebuke.

## Examples
### Example 1

هيّا سليم، انتبه!

Oh Salim, pay attention!

#### Explanation

Salim is close to the [communicator] but has been addressed as if he was far away. This highlights that Salim is not paying attention and is psychologically far away from the communicator.

### Example 2

يَـٰحَسْرَةً عَلَى ٱلْعِبَادِ ۚ

Ah! Alas for my servants.

[Qur'an 36:30]

#### Explanation

This statement is an expression of astonishment rather than an address.

# A-8: Definiteness and Indefiniteness
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/A-Sentence_Construction_and_Syntactical_Stylistics_(ilm_ul_maani)/A-8_Definiteness_and_Indefiniteness.pdf
## Definition

Definiteness and indefiniteness can be marked by the use of proper nouns, nicknames, personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, relative pronouns, genitive constructions, [the vocative] and the definite article _al-_.

Rhetorical effects may be achieved by the use of definiteness where indefiniteness is expected, and vice-versa, as well as by their use in unexpected ways.

## Examples

### Example 1 - Use of demonstrative pronouns to glorify, belittle, or mock

أهذا مدير الشركة؟

Is this the manager of the company?

#### Explanation

In this example, the use of _hadha_ (this) rather than _huwa_ (he) is a way of dehumanising and belittling the person.

### Example 2 - Use of relative pronoun to conceal someone’s identity

قابلتُ الذي كتب لي الرسالة الغريبة.

I met the one who wrote me the strange letter.

#### Explanation

The communicator has used _alladhī_ (who) to avoid mentioning the name of the person.

---
# A-9: Use of Pronoun in Place of Noun
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/A-Sentence_Construction_and_Syntactical_Stylistics_(ilm_ul_maani)/A-9_Use_of_Pronoun_in_Place_of_Noun.pdf
## Definition

In Arabic, pronouns typically refer back to a previously mentioned noun. However, for rhetorical purposes, a pronoun can be used before the noun it refers to is introduced. This can create uncertainty, heighten the addressee's interest, or increase the impact when the [referent] is eventually introduced. It can also signal a shared knowledge of the [referent] which not all parties have, thus creating tension or suspense.

## Examples
### Example 1

قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ

Say, "He is Allah — The One and Only".

[Qur'an 112:1]

#### Explanation

The huwa creates uncertainty before doubt is removed about the referent: Allah.

### Example 2

When Salim returns from having met Karim:

فاطمة: ماذا قلت له؟

Fatima: What did you say to him?

#### Explanation

Fatima uses the personal pronoun _lahu_ rather than mentioning his name. This is because the Salim already knows who Fatima is referring to.

---

# A-10: Use of Noun in Place of Pronoun
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/A-Sentence_Construction_and_Syntactical_Stylistics_(ilm_ul_maani)/A-10_Use_of_Noun_in_Place_of_Pronoun.pdf
## Definition

The communicator does not use a pronoun even though the proper name has already been mentioned. This emphasises and highlights the proper name. It is typically used to build a closer connection to the [referent].

A particular type of this device involves the repetition of the noun. This lexical repetition can achieve several rhetorical effects (see [Example 1].

## Examples
### Example 1

أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ حِزْبُ ٱللَّهِ ۚ أَلَآ إِنَّ حِزْبَ ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ

They are the party of Allah. Indeed, Allah’s party is bound to succeed.

[Qur'an 58:22]

#### Explanation

The second mention of Allah should have been made pronoun. However, the noun "Allah" is mentioned again for glorification.

### Example 2

When Salim returns from having met Karim:

فاطمة: ماذا قلتَ لكريم؟ قل لي ماذا قلتَ لكريم؟ أريد أن أعرف ما قلتَ لكريم.

Fatima: What did you say to Karim? Tell me what you said to Karim! I want to know what you said to Karim.

#### Explanation

After having mentioned Karim's name, it would be natural for Fatima to refer to Karim with the personal pronoun _huwa_. However, she uses Karim's name repeatedly, for rhetorical effect.

## Definition

Words and clauses that are semantically connected can be joined with connectors such as _wa_. Those that are not semantically connected should be separated.

Rhetorical effects may be achieved by joining words and clauses which do not have an apparent connection, and vice versa.

# A-12: Foregrounding and Backgrounding
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/A-Sentence_Construction_and_Syntactical_Stylistics_(ilm_ul_maani)/A-12_Foregrounding_and_Backgrounding.pdf
## Definition

**Foregrounding** is the bringing forwards of particular [lexical items] to nearer the beginning of the sentence. This emphasises or gives more importance to the lexical items which are foregrounded.

This can be utilised in the following situations:

- To convey implied information about the hierarchy of the lexical items within the sentence.
- To give good news or reassurance before giving bad news or criticism
- To control the order in which information is given, such as starting with the general, then proceeding to the specific, or vice-versa.
- To express astonishment, or to arouse fear in the addressee

Conversely, **backgrounding** is the moving of lexical items towards the end of the sentence. It may reduce the emphasis on those items, or it may also build a sense of suspense in the addressee. Foregrounding and backgrounding may also be employed for the purpose of the rhythm or metre of a sentence or verse of poetry.

## Example

فَإِذَا أَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَاءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ

And when We pour down rain on it, it is stirred to life, it swells.

[Qur'an 22:5]

#### Explanation

Foregrounding “ihtazzat” (it stirred) serves to create a vivid, emotionally resonant image of the earth's revival, aligning more closely with perception, enhancing rhythm, and supporting the theme of resurrection.

# A-13: Brevity, Verbosity and Moderation
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/A-Sentence_Construction_and_Syntactical_Stylistics_(ilm_ul_maani)/A-13_Brevity_Verbosity_and_Moderation.pdf
## Definition

The [lexical item] under investigation should demonstrate a length which is appropriate to the context and the communicative needs demanded of it.

**Brevity** and succinctness may be achieved by:

- Using precise words which convey expansive meanings and
- Omission of lexical items which are not essential to conveying the intended meaning, which could be inferred, or which are already known to the addressee.

Conversely, it may be appropriate to be **verbose** in order to achieve a rhetorical outcome. This may occur:

- When more information, details or clarification are required to be transmitted (الإيضاح بعد الإبهام),
- When further clarification is required,
- As a means of affirmation of the information already supplied,
- To influence the addressee by appealing to the addressee’s emotions.
- With parenthetical asides (الاعتراض)
- With protective qualification (الاحتراس)
- In tail-end emphasis (التذييل)
- In purposeful repetition (التكرار)
- In specifying a particular after a general (ذكر الخاص بعد العام)
- In elaborating on a general statement (التفصيل بعد الإجمال)

A text is said to show **moderation** when there is a balance between verbosity and brevity.

## Example

هذه الجامعة من أفضل الجامعات في البلاد بالنسبة للطالب. فاز نائب المستشار مؤخرًا بجائزة نوبل.

For a student, this is one of the best universities in the country. The Vice-Chancellor recently won a Nobel prize.

#### Explanation

This is an example of Elaboration after Generality verbosity (تفصيل بعد إجمال). The Vice-Chancellor winning a Nobel Prize does not directly affect the quality of teaching but is a reflection of the excellence of the institution overall.

# A-14: Ellipsis
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/A-Sentence_Construction_and_Syntactical_Stylistics_(ilm_ul_maani)/A-14_Ellipsis.pdf
## Definition

The omission of certain lexical items to create a rhetorical effect, such as:

- Making the sentence more succinct
- Where the omitted information is already known to the addressee
- To convey emotion more succinctly
- To evoke an immediate response from the addressee
- For the sake of rhyme, metre or musicality
- Evoking suspicion or interest by concealing the identity of the subject
- To convey some fixed expressions

There are several specific types of ellipsis as described below.

## Inferential Sufficiency (al-iktifāʾ)

The selective use of part of a word or sentence, relying on the listener to infer the missing part. It differs from A-14: Ellipsis in that the completion intentionally relies on the listener's knowledge of the missing part. This technique relies on the shared knowledge of idioms, expressions and famous sayings to create a sense of suggestiveness, subtlety, or wit.

## Examples
### Example 1

سيد القوم...

The leader of the people...

#### Explanation

The listener is expected to know the ending of this idiom: "خادمهم..." ("...is their servant.") This idiom encapsulates the idea that true leadership is based on humility and service.

### Example 2

إذا طاح الجمل...

When the camel falls...

#### Explanation

The listener is expected to know the ending of this idiom: "كثرت سكاكينه..." ("...the knives multiply.") This idiom is used to describe betrayal or opportunism when someone powerful is in decline. Quoting only the beginning is stylistically sufficient, and carries a loaded irony that the full explanation would ruin.

## Interweaving ((al-iḥtibāk))

A rhetorical device involving omitting parts of a sentence or verse in such a way that what is omitted in one part is clarified by what is mentioned in the other. This causes an interweaving of sentences, due to the mutual dependency between two semantic parts.

### Example

قَالَ لَهُم مُّوسَىٰ وَيْلَكُمْ لَا تَفْتَرُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِبًا فَيُسْحِتَكُم بِعَذَابٍ ۖ وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنِ افْتَرَىٰ

Moses warned the magicians, "Woe to you! Do not fabricate a lie against Allah, or He will wipe you out with a torment. Whoever fabricates lies is bound to fail."

[Qur'an 20:61]

#### Explanation

In the first clause ("Do not fabricate a lie against Allah, or He will wipe you out with a torment."), there is a threat of punishment for fabrication — but no statement about it being wrong. In the second clause ("Whoever fabricates lies is bound to fail"), there is condemnation of the act — but no mention of punishment. Each clause has part of the meaning with the other part being suppressed, but understood from the opposite side. So, the complete meaning — fabricating lies is both morally wrong and leads to destruction — emerges only by combining the two halves.

# B-1: Simile
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/B-Figurative_Speech_(ilm_ul_bayaan)/B-1_Simile.pdf
## Definition

A simile is a rhetoric device where:

- Something – termed the “**likened-to**” (_al-mushabbah_)...
- ...is described as being compared with Something Else – termed the “**likened**” (_al-musbabbah bihi_)...
- ...with which it shares a common attribute – termed the “**simile feature**” (_wajah al-tashbīh_).

The **likened** is more intense in the **simile feature** than the **likened-to**.

The two ends of the simile (_al-ṭarafān_) – the **likened-to** and the **likened** – are connected by the **simile element** (_ʾadāt al-tashbīh_) which may be:

- The particles _ka-_ (“as”) and _kaʾanna_ (“as if”)
- Verbs like _shābaha_, _māthala_, _ḍāhā_, _ḥākā_, _ḍāraʿa_ connotating resemblance and similarity
- Nouns such as _mathala_, _mathīl_, _shibh_, _shabīh_, _mushābih_, _muḍāriʿ_ connotating resemblance and similarity.

## Types of simile

Various components of the simile can be omitted to create a heightened rhetorical effect:

### 1) Detailed simile (_al-tashbīh al-mufaṣṣal_)

All four elements of the simile are present in the detailed simile.

سليم كأسد في الشجاعة.

Salim is like a lion in courage.

#### Explanation

All four elements of the simile are present in this example:

- Likened-to: Salim
- Likened: a lion
- Simile feature: courage
- Simile element: like

  

### 2) Single simile (_al-tashbīh al-mufrad_)

The simile feature is omitted in the single simile.

سليم كأسد.

Salim is like a lion.

#### Explanation

The simile feature ("in courage") has been omitted.

  

### 3) Multiple simile (_al-tashbīh al-mutaʿaddid_)

The multiple simile contains more than one simile feature.

سليم كأسد في الشجاعة والجمال.

Salim is like a lion in courage and beauty.

#### Explanation

There are multiple simile features with which Salim is compared with a lion: courage and beauty.

  

### 4) Compound simile (al-tashbīh al-murakkab)

In the compound simile, the simile feature is omitted and the likened is replaced with an image.

سليم كملك الحيوانات.

Salim is like the king of the animals.

#### Explanation

Rather than describing a specific quality of the lion such as courage, the communicator paints a picture of the lion, to which Salim may be compared with.

  

### 5) Effective simile (_al-tashbīh al-balīgh_)

The effective simile consists of only the likened and the likened-to.

سليم أسد.

Salim is a lion.

#### Explanation

The simile feature and the simile element have both been omitted.

  

### 6) Reverse simile (_al-tashbīh al-maqlūb_)

In the reverse simile, the likened resembles the likened-to, rather than the other way round.

الأسد كسليم.

The lion is like Salim.

#### Explanation

The lion is described as being like Salim, even though Salim is the subject of the description.

### 7) Implicit simile (_al-tashbīh al-ḍimniyy_)

In the implicit simile, when referring to the likened-to, only an attribute of the likened is mentioned.

لا يخشى الأسد أحداً.

A lion fears no-one.

#### Explanation

Salim is described by mentioning the quality of the lion. The implicit meaning is that Salim shares that quality with the lion.

  

### 8) Imaginary simile (_al-tashbīh al-wahamiyy_)

In the imaginary simile, imaginary attributes are assigned to the likened.

سليم كأسد ذو رأسين.

Salim is like a lion with two heads.

#### Explanation

The lion which Salim resembles is described as having an imaginary feature: two heads. This exaggerates the lion's and Salim's features.

@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/B-Figurative_Speech_(ilm_ul_bayaan)/B-2_Metaphor.pdf
## Definition

A metaphor is a rhetorical device which is derived from the “[effective simile]” which consists of the likened-to and the likened only. To make a metaphor, either the likened-to or the likened is omitted.

## Example

سليم أسد.

Salim is a lion.  
   
...becomes...

دخل أسدٌ الغرفة.

A lion entered the room.

## Types of metaphor

The types of metaphor include:

### 1) Explicit metaphor (_al-istiʿāra al-taṣrīḥiyya_)

As in the example above, the likened-to is omitted in the explicit metaphor, and only the likened is mentioned.

  

### 2) Implicit metaphor (_al-istiʿāra al-makaniyyah_)

In the implicit metaphor, the likened is omitted and something contextually symbolic from it is mentioned instead.

زأر الملك على الجموع.

The King roared at the crowds.

### 3) Enhanced metaphor (_al-istiʿāra al-murashshaḥa_)

An enhanced metaphor is an implicit metaphor with additional description of the likened.

زأر الملك على الجموع وصعد إلى المنصة جلالة.

The King roared at the crowds as he majestically ascended to the podium.

### 4) Naked metaphor (_al-istiʿāra al-mujarrida_)

A naked metaphor is an explicit metaphor which is enhanced with lexical items appropriate to the likened.

دخل أسدٌ الغرفة وكان يرتدي بدلة راقية.

A lion entered the room and he was wearing an classy suit.

### 5) Absolute metaphor (_al-istiʿāra al-muṭlaqa_)

An absolute metaphor is an explicit metaphor which either does not include any lexical items relevant to the likened or the likened-to, or includes items which are relevant to both.

### 6) Proverbial metaphor (_al-istiʿāra al-tamthīliyya_)

A proverbial metaphor draws attention to received wisdom in an allegorical way.

## Definition

Tamthīl is when an entire idea, sentence, or situation is used figuratively to represent another situation that is conceptually similar. Tamthīl is based on the analogy between two complete propositions, not individual words. The two situations are not compared by way of single attributes (as in [simile] or [metaphor], but through a shared logic, structure, or moral insight. The communicator invites the listener to draw an inference from one domain and apply it to another, often indirectly. Sometimes, tamthīl is used ironically or fallaciously, creating a "mock analogy" to provoke, entertain, or critique as it relies on flawed or exaggerated reasoning. This is known as al-tamthīl al-mukhtala‘.

## Examples
### Example 1

إن كنت فوق الناس، وأنت منهم، فالمِسك بعضُ دمِ الغزال.

If you are above all men, though one of them – well, musk is part of the blood of the gazelle.

- Al-Mutanabbī

#### Explanation

Al-Mutanabbī compares a prince to musk and the people to gazelle’s blood. The analogy is not based on surface attributes but on a structural logic: something rare and valuable (musk / the prince) can originate from a common source (gazelle / people), yet be incomparable in worth.

### Example 2

ألم تضعني في يمينك؟ فلا تضعني بعد ذلك في شمالك!

Had you not placed me into your right hand? So do not place me after that into your left!

- Ibn Mayyāda

#### Explanation

Ibn Mayyāda uses the metaphor of right and left hands to illustrate the shift from honour to disgrace. The analogy rests not on the body parts themselves, but on their symbolic and cultural values.

# B-4: Allegory
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/B-Figurative_Speech_(ilm_ul_bayaan)/B-4_Allegory.pdf
## Definition

Allegory is taking a word which has one meaning, and using it in a different but closely related way.

## Types of allegory

There are two types of allegory:

### 1) Cognitive allegory (_al-majāz al-ʿaqlī_)

The subject of a verb is not the literal subject of that verb and the addressee is required to think about who the literal subject is. The allegorical subject and the real subject share a relationship which may take one of several forms:

#### (a) Causality (_al-ʿalāqa al-sababiyya_) relationship

أعلنت الحكومة قواعد جديدة.

The government has announced new laws.

The government is not an entity that can literally announce new laws. Rather, the [communicator] is using the word "government" in a figurative way to refer to government officials who have **caused** the announcement to come about.

مشى الأمريكيون على سطح القمر عام 1969.

The Americans walked on the moon in 1969.

The communicator mentions "Americans" in general, but in reality, only two astronauts actually walked on the moon in 1969. The communicator is referring to the American science, technology, culture, economy and industry - the American nation as a whole - which was behind the moon landings of 1969, when saying that "the Americans" have walked on the moon.

#### (b) Time (_al-ʿalāqa al-zamāniyya_) relationship

يمر الوقت بسرعة في العطلة.

Time passes fast in the holidays.

Time is not able to literally pass by. The communicator is using "time" in a figurative way to indicate that the **time duration** of the holidays feels short.

#### (c) Place relationship (_al-ʿalāqa al-maḥaliyya_)

تلهم المدينةُ الإبداع.

The city inspires creativity.

The city itself is not able to inspire creativity. The communicator is alluding to factors **located** with the city that inspire creativity.

### 2) Linguistic allegory (hypallage, _al-majāz al-mursal_)

There are contextual clues to the relationship between the allegorical and the real meanings. This relationship can take one of several forms:

#### (a) Synecdoche

The whole is allegorically mentioned but only the part is intended literally, or vice-versa. There can be a whole-to-part relationship (_al-ʿalāqa al-kulliyya_) or a part-to-whole relationship (_al-ʿalāqa al-juzʾiyya_) between the allegorical and the literal:

رأيت لندن في عطلتي.

I saw London in my holiday.

The communicator does not mean to say that the whole of London was seen in the holiday. However, by mentioning "London", it is understood that only certain specific areas of London were actually seen. Although the whole is mentioned, only a part is intended. This may convey the sense that the major parts of London, or the most significant parts of London were seen, although not literally every part.

تعال إلى بيتي لتناول الشاي الساعة 4 مساءً.

Come to my house for tea at 4pm.

#### Explanation

The communicator invites the [addressee] for tea. However, it is understood that this is an invitation for a visit which incorporates tea, chat, discussion or socialising, and not literally just the tea. By referring to the part, the communicator is referring to the whole. The ultimate objective of the visit is not specified, which leads to a sense of ambiguity, which is the rhetorical aim.

#### (b) Place relationship (_al-ʿalāqa al-maḥaliyya_)

The communicator mentions a place, but something related to the place is intended, or vice-versa.

يمكن أن تكون المحاكم في الهند فاسدة.

The courts in India can be corrupt.

The communicator refers to "the courts in India." However, the intention is not to talk about Indian courts in particular. The communicator is referring to the entire legal system in India, or the justice system of the country in general.

زرتُ عائلة صديقي.

I visited my friend’s family

The communicator mentions the friend's family, but the intention is to refer to the city, town, village or neighbourhood where the friend's family lives. This is achieved without mentioning details such as the name of the locality visited.

#### (c) Causality relationship (_al-ʿalāqa al-sababiyya_)

The communicator mentions the cause, but the effect is intended.

صديقي فتح عيني على الفساد في المجتمع.

My friend opened my eyes to the corruption in society.

The communicator mentions the eyes that were opened. This caused the communicator to become aware of corruption in society.

#### (d) Effect relationship (_al-ʿalāqa al-musababiyya_)

The communicator mentions the result, but the cause is intended.

العمل الجيد يضع الطعام على الطاولة.

A good job puts food on the table.

The communicator intends to say that a good job leads to a good and stable income. The effect of that is that food can be put on the table.

#### (e) Past relationship (_iʿtibār mā kāna_)

The communicator mentions something from the past, but in the present.

ترك طفلي المنزل للالتحاق بالجامعة.

My child left home to attend university.

The one who left home is an adult, but the communicator refers to the child that the adult **was**.

#### (f) Future relationship (_iʿtibar mā sayakūnu_)

The communicator mentions something from the future, but in the present

أزرعُ شجرة تفاح.

I am planting an apple tree.

The communicator is planting an apple seed or sapling, but refers to what it **will be** in the future: an apple tree.

#### (g) Opposite relationship (_al-ʿalāqa ḍiddiyya_)

The communicator intends the opposite of what is said.

أتمنى أن تستمتع بحرياتك الجديدة بعد استقالتك.

I hope you enjoy your new freedoms, now that you have resigned.

#### (h) Generalisation relationship (_al-ʿalāqa al-ʿumūm_)

The communicator make a generalisation.

الهنود فقراء.

Indians are poor.

#### (i) Specific relationship (_al-ʿalāqa al-khuṣūṣiyya_)

The communicator mentions a general thing, but a specific thing is intended.

تساعد الحمية الصحية في وقاية المرض

A healthy diet can help prevent illness.

The communicator mentions a healthy diet in general, but the intention the specific components of a diet such as vitamins and minerals which can prevent disease.

## Definition

Implicit Reference (_Kināya_) is the use of a descriptive word or phrase which alludes to the intrinsic characteristics of a thing, in place of the real name. Although the connection between the implicit reference and the real word is allegorical, it must be possible for the implicit reference to be literally true as well, which differentiates it from [metaphor].

## Example

سليم لسانه طويل.

Salim’s tongue is long.

#### Explanation

Describing Salim’s tongue as being long implies that he talks a lot, or that he has vulgar or deceitful speech. However, it could also mean that his tongue is literally quite long.

_Also known as **Paronomasia**, **Double-Entendre**, **التخييل** and **Delusion**_
## Definition

This is the use of an expression that has more than one meaning. The speaker says one thing, but there is more than one interpretation of the meaning. This causes a joking, ironic, sarcastic or mocking effect due to the deliberate confusion caused, between the superficial meaning, and the construed meaning. The speaker technically speaking does not lie, as both interpretations are correct.

## Definition

The occurrence of two words which sound similar but have different meanings.

## Types of Paronomasia

There are several types of Paronomasia:

### (A) Complete Paronomasia (al-jinās al-tāmm)

The two words are identical but they have different meanings. This is also known as a [pun].

  

### (B) Incomplete Paronomasia (al-jinās ghayr al-tāmm)

The two words differ in one aspect such as:

1.  Reverse Paronomasia (jinās al-qalb)
    
    The letter order is changed to make an anagram or a [palindrome].
    
1.  Morphological Paronomasia (jinās al-ishtiqāq)
    
    The two words are derived from the same root but have different morphological forms.
    
1.  Fabricated Paronomasia (al-jinās al-mulaffaq)
    
    Two unrelated words that sound the same appear together.
    
1.  Resemblance Paronomasia (al-jinās al-muḍariʿ)
    
    The two words differ by one letter, but the different letters have the same point of articulation.
    
1.  Non-resemblance Paronomasia (al-jinās al-lāḥiq)
    
    The two words differ by one letter, and the different letters have different points of articulation.
    
1.  Distorted Paronomasia (al-jinās al-muḥarraf)
    
    The two words are the same but have a difference in a vowel.

_Also known as **Antonymy**, **المقابلة**, **المطابقة** and **تضادّ**_
## Definition

Two [antonyms] appear together, such as “big” and “small.” The two words may be allegorical or non-allegorical.

The antithesis construct may be either non-negated antithesis using direct opposites such as “true” and “false,” or negated antithesis using negation of the same word (such as “true” and “not true”). The antithesis may occur between two nouns, two verbs, two particles, or any combination of these. Multiple antithesis may occur where two or more antonyms or antonymic phrases appear together.

## Example

فَلْيَضْحَكُوا۟ قَلِيلًا وَلْيَبْكُوا۟ كَثِيرًا جَزَآءًۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْسِبُونَ

Quran 9:82  
So let them laugh a little—they will weep much as a reward for what they have committed.

#### Explanation

There is a semantic opposition between _yaḍḥakū_ (laugh) and _yabkū_ (cry), and between _qalīlan_ (a little) and _kathīr_ (a lot).

@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/C-Linguistic_Embellishments_(ilm-ul-badi)/CB-Contrasts_and_Inversions/CB-5_Reversal_of_Word_Order.pdf
## Definition

This category includes rhetorical devices that reverse the structure or order of words in a sentence, often to create symmetry, contrast, or emphasis. Unlike lexical contrasts such as [CB-1: Antithesis (_al-ṭibāq_)], these devices work at the level of syntax and word arrangement.

## 1) _al-In‘ikās al-Tarkībī_

Reversing or exchanging two terms or ideas, often to highlight contrast or paradox. It may overlap with [chiasmus] and [antimetabole].

### Example

لا مجدَ في الدنيا لمن قلّ مالهُ، ولا مالَ في الدنيا لمن قلّ مجدهُ

There is no glory in this world for him whose wealth is little,  
and no wealth for him whose glory is little.

- Al Mutanabbī

## 2) Chiasmus

A construction involving the inversion of structure, but not necessarily the exact words. A reverse-parallel structure (A:B → B':A').

### Examples

He knowingly led and we followed blindly.

She has all my love; my heart belongs to her.

He led bravely, and bravely we followed.

## 3) Antimetabole

A more strict construction than chiasmus, where the order of words or concepts is strictly mirrored in reverse (A:B -> B:A structure).

### Examples

When the going gets tough, the tough get going.

Fair is foul, and foul is fair

## 4) _al-Muqābala al-‘Aksiyya_

A structured contrast involving two or more pairs of opposites, typically mirrored in reverse. The mirrored construction can be used to reverse the polarities of meanings, causing not only a syntactic but also a semantic inversion.

### Example

يُخْرِجُ ٱلْحَىَّ مِنَ ٱلْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ ٱلْمَيِّتَ مِنَ ٱلْحَىِّ

Quran 30:19  
He brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living

# CC-1: Repetition
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/C-Linguistic_Embellishments_(ilm-ul-badi)/CC-Repetition_and_Reinforcement/CC-1_Repetition.pdf
## Definition

Repeated use of a [lexical item] for a rhetoric purpose such as emphasis, praise or criticism. There are several types of Repetition.

## Types of Repetition

### 1) Repetition for emphasis

_Also known as **التكرار التوكيدي** and **التكرار اللفظي**_

The repetition of a word or phrase in immediate succession for rhetoric purposes such as emphasis and affirmation. The repeated words or phrases have the same meaning and application.

#### Example 1

"فَإِنَّ مَعَ ٱلْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا  
إِنَّ مَعَ ٱلْعُسْرِ يُسْرًۭا"

"Verily with hardship come ease.  
Verily with hardship comes ease."  
— [Qur'ān 94:5-6]

#### Explanation

The phrase "Verily with hardship comes ease" is repeated with the same meaning in both instances.


#### Example 2

كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ  
ثُمَّ كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ

But no! You will soon come to know.  
Again, no! You will soon come to know.  
— [Qur'ān 102:3-4]

#### Explanation

The phrase “sawfa ta‘lamūn” (“you will soon come to know”) is repeated verbatim with the same meaning for heightened emphasis and rhetorical impact.



#### Example 3

"Our top priority was, is and always will be education, education, education."  
— Tony Blair

#### Explanation

The word "education" is repeated with the same meaning in each instance.



#### Further Information

- [Epizeuxis / Palilogia]

### 2) Distributed Repetition

_Also known as **الترديد**_

The repetition of a word or phrase separated by another word or phrase. The repeated words or phrases can have the same or different meanings and applications.

#### Example

وَهو العَظيمُ مِنَ الرّبِّ العظيمِ أتَى       يُبْدي العَظيمَ مِنَ الآياتِ والحِكَمِ

He is the great one, [apostle] of the Great Lord, who came  
To display great signs and wisdom.  
—Al-Nāblusī

#### Explanation

The same word al-‘aẓīm is used 3 times. In each case it has a different inflectional form: nominative in the first instance, genitive in the second instance, and accusative in the third instance.

#### See Also

- [CA-1: Complete Paronomasia] where the same word is used with different meanings
- [B-7: Pun] where the same phrase is repeated with different meanings

#### Further Information

- [Ploce]

### 3) Terminal Repetition

_Also known as **تكرار النهاية**_

Repetition of the same word or expressions at the end of the sentence for affirmation.

#### See also

- [Epistrophe]

### 4) Emphatic Repetition

Where the repeated element could have been included in a general term, but is intentionally mentioned separately for effect.

## Example

سليم مؤدب ولطيف وصبور.

Salim is polite, kind and patient.

#### Explanation

The noun “Salim” is modified by the descriptors “polite,” “kind” and “patient”.

## Definition

The communicator responds to a question with an evasive or ambiguous response. This evokes an effect in the addressee.
## Example

كريم: كم عمرك؟  
سليم: لماذا تريد معرفة هذه المعلومة الشخصية؟

Karim: How old are you?  
Salim: Why do you want this personal information?

## Definition

The communicator intentionally uses a word which can change its meaning through a small change in the word itself. This causes ambiguity in the communicator's intended meaning, so that the communicator may avoid being committed to one of the two meanings.

## Example

لقد ضاع شعري على بابِكُم  
كما ضاعَ عِقدٌ على خالِصَة

My poetry was lost at your doorstep,  
Just as a necklace was lost on Khāliṣa.

- Abū Nuwās

#### Explanation

And when Caliph al-Rashīd objected to the line, Abū Nuwās claimed he said لقد ضاءَ شعري على بابِكُم - كما ضاءَ عِقدٌ على خالِصَة where the original phrase "ضاع شعري" (my poetry was lost) could be changed to "ضاء شعري" (my poetry shone), and "ضاعَ عِقدٌ" (a necklace was lost) could be read as "ضاءَ عِقدٌ" (a necklace shone). These minor changes result in completely different interpretations of the line of poetry.

# CD-4: Euphemism
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/C-Linguistic_Embellishments_(ilm-ul-badi)/CD-Indirectness_and_Ambiguity/CD-4_Euphemism.pdf
## Definition

The communicator uses an implicit reference rather than explicitly referring to something unpleasant or embarrassing.

## Types of Euphemism

### 1) Euphemistic metaphors

Replacement of a direct or offensive term with a figurative or metaphorical expression to soften its impact.

#### Example

انتقلت إلى رحمة الله.

She transferred to the mercy of God.

#### Explanation

It means "She died," where "transferring to the mercy of God" is an euphemism for death.

### 2) Antonymic euphemisms

A euphemism that replaces a negative term with its positive or desirable opposite, reflecting optimism or cultural norms. Examples include مُعافى "healthy" to refer to someone who is sick, بصير "sighted" to refer to someone who is blind, and عائدون "returnees" to refer to refugees.

### 3) Circumlocutions

A euphemism that uses a roundabout or descriptive phrase to avoid stating something unpleasant or taboo directly.

#### Example

لم يُحالفه الحظ.

Luck did not ally with him.

#### Explanation

This means he failed.

### 4) Remodeling / phonetic play

A euphemism formed by intentionally distorting the sound or structure of a taboo word to mask its directness while preserving its implication.

#### Example

يلعن ديكك.

Damn your rooster!

#### Explanation

This is a euphemism for يلعن دينك "Damn your religion!" where the word ديك "rooster" is used instead of دين "religion".

### 5) Understatements

A euphemism that downplays a serious or negative event by choosing a milder or less emotionally charged word, such as the use of the word نكسة "setback" instead of هزيمة "defeat".

### 6) Borrowing of foreign words

A euphemism achieved by substituting a native term with a foreign loanword that carries more prestige or social acceptability, such as the word مادام "Madame" instead of زوجة or مرأة "wife".

### 7) Use of euphemizers

A euphemism-supporting strategy where polite phrases are added to soften the effect of taboo or undesirable words, such as the use of حاشاك meaning "May this not apply to you!" after mentioning something distasteful like حمار "donkey".

# CD-5: Referential Shift
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/C-Linguistic_Embellishments_(ilm-ul-badi)/CD-Indirectness_and_Ambiguity/CD-5_Referential_Shift.pdf
## Definition

The communicator mentions something, and then later uses a personal pronoun or demonstrative pronoun to apparently refer back to that thing. However, something related but different is intended by the pronoun. This could be a different meaning of a homonym (semantic shift), or a related but distinct [referent] (referential shift). This ambiguity creates a rhetorical effect by playing on the listener’s assumption of continuity, only to redirect their interpretation.

## Example

فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ ٱلشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ

Quran 2: 185  
So whoever is present this month, let them fast it.

#### Explanation

The word _shahar_ (month) refers to the new crescent moon signifying the start of the month of Ramadan. Whereas the _hu_ (it) apparently refers to the crescent moon, but actually refers to something else - the days of Ramadan - and not the crescent moon itself.

## Definition

A word or expression is used to modify multiple words or phrases, but with different meanings or implications for each. Often involves a verb with both literal and figurative extensions.

## Example

فتحت له بابها وقلبها.

She opened her door and her heart to him.

#### Explanation

The word “opened” has a literal meaning with opening the door, and an figurative meaning with opening her heart.

## Definition

This is to combine several things together and give a collective verdict or judgement on them together.

## Examples
### Example 1

دفاترك وأقلامك وكل جهدك ستكون ضرورية عند بدء العام الدراسي الجديد.

Your notebooks, your pens, and all your efforts will be essential when the new school year begins.

#### Explanation

"Your notebooks", "your pens" and "all your efforts" are combined with the same judgement, of being required.

### Example 2

وَاصْبِرْ نَفْسَكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِيِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُ

And keep yourself patient with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His Face.

[Qur'an 18:28]

#### Explanation

"Morning" and "evening" are combined to share the same predicate: calling upon their Lord.

### Example 3

ٱلْمَالُ وَٱلْبَنُونَ زِينَةُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا

Wealth and children are [but] adornment of the worldly life.

[Qur'an 18:46]

#### Explanation

المَال and البَنُون share one predicate: زِينَةُ الحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا. The grammatical structure shows jam‘ under one ḥukm.

### Example 4

إِنَّمَا ٱلْخَمْرُ وَٱلْمَيْسِرُ وَٱلْأَنصَابُ وَٱلْأَزْلَامُ رِجْسٌ

Wine, gambling, altars, and divining arrows are all filth...

[Qur'an 5:90]

#### Explanation

There are four distinct nouns with one collective ruling: رِجْسٌ (impure/filth).

# CE-3: Semantic Grouping
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/C-Linguistic_Embellishments_(ilm-ul-badi)/CE-Grouping_and_Distinguishing/CE-3_Semantic_Grouping.pdf
_Also known as **al-Tanāsub**, **al-I'tilāf** and **al-Tawfīq**_
## Definition

This is a rhetorical device where multiple, often related or similar, qualities or details are grouped together to enhance emphasis or create a rich, detailed picture.

There are several types of semantic grouping.

## 1) Descriptive (تعداد وصفي)

Listing qualities or features that contribute to an overall impression.

### Example

يقع هذا البيت في حي رائع، في حالة جيدة لعمره، قريب من مدرسة متميزة، والسعر معقول. هو مناسب تماماً لنا!

This house is located in a great neighbourhood, in good condition for its age, close to an excellent school, and the price is reasonable. It is perfect for us!

#### Explanation

The communicator lists several different but thematically related qualities of the house which contribute to a single point: the house is desirable.

## 2) Semantic (تعداد معنوي)

Listing conceptually or thematically related ideas, often to amplify moral, emotional, or theological messages.

### Example

كَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ كَانُوا أَشَدَّ مِنكُمْ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرَ أَوْلَادًا وَأَوْلَادًا

Like those before you: they were stronger than you, and had more wealth and children...

[Qur'an 9:69]

#### Explanation

The joining of strength, wealth, and children shows semantic association, building emphasis through related terms.

## 3) Imagistic (تعداد تصويري)

Using rich, often poetic, similes or metaphors from the same semantic domain.

### Example

(...emaciated camels) like curved bows, nay, like the arrows, when whittled sharp, nay, like the bowstrings.

- [Al-Buḥturī]

#### Explanation

Emaciated camels are described with three related similes from the same semantic domain (archery): like curved bows, like sharpened arrows, and like bowstrings.

## 4) Contextual/Associative (مراعاة النظير)

The joining of semantically or contextually linked terms to preserve coherence, harmony, or appropriateness in meaning, to emphasise their connectedness.

### Example

إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ سَمِيعًۢا بَصِيرًۭا

"Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."

[Qur'an 4:58]

#### Explanation

The words "Samī‘" (All-Hearing) and "Baṣīr" (All-Seeing) are contextually paired because they refer to two complementary modes of divine perception—hearing and sight from the same semantic domain (perception/sensory awareness), making them rhetorically harmonious and theologically balanced.

# CE-4: Dividing Items

## Definition

This is a rhetorical device where a general category or statement is broken down into its constituent parts, and each part is assigned a specific trait, action, or outcome. It is used to create emphasis, rhythm, or clarity through structured elaboration.

Al-Taqsīm can take several forms:

- Contrastive Attribution: opposing traits assigned to different cases.
- Logical Enumeration: listing all possibilities (like a disjunction).
- Mutual Characterization: one part clarifies or defines the other.

## Example

يجب على الطالب قبل بداية العام الدراسي أن يشتري دفاتر جديدة للكتابة، وأن يرتب مكتبه للمذاكرة، وأن يجد أقلامه لأداء الواجبات.

Before the new school year begins, the student must buy new notebooks for writing, organise their desk for studying, and find pens for doing homework.

## Definition

This is a rhetorical device where a general collective statement is made first (_jam‘_), and then this is divided or detailed (_taqsīm_).

## Example

ٱللَّهُ يَتَوَفَّى ٱلْأَنفُسَ حِينَ مَوْتِهَا وَٱلَّتِى لَمْ تَمُتْ فِى مَنَامِهَا

God takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that did not die [He takes] during their sleep...

[Qur'an 39:42]

#### Explanation

This verse is structured as a general statement first, then detailed elaboration.

## Definition

The communicator first combines multiple subjects under a shared predicate, and then differentiates them with individual qualifiers or extensions. This technique subtly unifies and differentiates, adding nuance by showing a shared attribute that branches into distinct meanings.

## Example
### Example 1

[وجهك كالنار في ضوئها، وقلبي كالنار في حرها.]

Your face is like fire in its light and my heart is like fire in its heat.

- [Rashīd al-Dīn al-Waṭwāṭ]

#### Explanation

Both "your face" and "my heart" are joined by the comparison to fire, but the aspects (light and heat) are then separated out and applied appropriately.

### Example 2

خَلَقْتَنِي مِن نَّارٍ وَخَلَقْتَهُ مِن طِينٍ

You created me from fire, and him from clay.

[Qur'an 7:12]

#### Explanation

Adam and Iblis share the attribute of being created by Allah, but the differentiation is that Iblis was created from fire and Adam was created from clay.

# CE-7: Differentiating Between Similar Items

## Definition

This is to differentiate between two things that mistakenly could be considered to be same. It emphasizes the contrast in nature, value, or context between similar acts or entities, especially when they are performed or possessed by different agents. The rhetorical effect is to sharpen meaning, correct assumptions, or rhetorically elevate one party over another by highlighting qualitative differences within an apparently shared activity.

## Examples
### Example 1

سليم وكريم كلاهما من الطلاب الجيدين، غير أن سليمًا يتفوق بطبعه، وكريمًا لا يرقى إلا بجهده.

Saleem and Karim are both good students, but Saleem is naturally superior, while Karim only advances through his own effort.

### Example 2

The gift of the clouds at some time in the rainy season is not like the gift of the prince on a day of generosity;  
for the gift of the prince is a camel-load of dinars and the gift of the clouds a drop of water.

- [Rashīd al-Dīn al-Waṭwāṭ]

#### Explanation

Both the clouds and the prince are giving something. However, the prince is rhetorically differentiated as being more generous than the clouds.

### Example 3

وَمَا يَسْتَوِي الْبَحْرَانِ هَـٰذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ سَائِغٌ شَرَابُهُ وَهَـٰذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ.

The two seas are not equal: one is fresh and sweet, the other is salty and bitter.

[Qur'an 35:12]

#### Explanation

The seas seem similar (“both are seas”), but are sharply differentiated in taste and benefit.

## Definition

The communicator mentions two or more items in succession: this is the "Folding" (اللفّ). Then, further information is "Unfolded" (النشر) about these items. The unfolding can be:

- In a parallel sequence (النشر المرتّب),
- In a crossed-over (chiasmus) sequence (النشر غير المرتّب), or
- In an ambiguous sequence (النشر المشوش).

With the parallel or crossed-over sequences, the addressee is expected to understand which piece of information corresponds with which item, without the communicator having to specify this explicitly.

## Example

الشمس والقمر مختلفان تمامًا: أحدهما يخلق الضوء، والآخر يعكسه فقط.

The sun and moon are very different: one creates light, the other merely reflects it.

#### Explanation

Out of the sun and the moon, it is not explicitly mentioned which one creates light, and which one reflects light. However, the communicator expects that the addressee would infer or understand which is which.

## Definition

The communicator repeats the lexical, syntactic, or rhythmic structure of a sentence or phrase across two or more phrases, clauses, or sentences to create semantic balance, assonance, rhyme, or rhetorical emphasis.

## Types of parallelism

### 1) Lexical parallelism

Repetition of word forms or vocabulary across phrases (e.g. he came, he saw, he conquered).

#### Example

He came, he saw, he conquered.

### 2) Syntactic parallelism

Matching sentence structures (e.g. To err is human; to forgive, divine).

#### Example

To err is human; to forgive, divine.

### 3) Phonetic parallelism

Use of similar sounds for musical effect (e.g. alliteration, rhyme).

#### Example

# CF-5: Digression
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/C-Linguistic_Embellishments_(ilm-ul-badi)/CF-Paragraph_Structure_and_Flow/CF-5_Digression.pdf
_Also known as **Excursus**_
## Definition

The communicator mentions one topic, then leaves that topic and mentions something else which may be the opposite or contrasting to the original topic, then returns to complete the original topic. The rhetorical effect is particularly pronounced when the digression has an ironic, sarcastic, or praising intent.

## Example

أنا أحب برمنغهام، إنها مدينة رائعة. ليست مثل لندن حيث الناس بائسون دائمًا. يوجد في برمنغهام الكثير من المساحات الخضراء والناس سعداء.

I love Birmingham, it's a great city. It's not like London where the people are always miserable. Birmingham has a lot of green spaces and people are happy.

#### Explanation

The communicator praises Birmingham, then digresses to talk of the problems of London, then returns to talk about Birmingham. The digression has a critical tone against London, which emphasises the contrast with Birmingham.

## Definition

A rhetorical technique where the validity of a new statement is derived from a previous one. This serves as a justification for a change in topic that favours the communicator's objective.

## Example

ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبُ لَا رَيْبَ ۛ فِيهِ ۛ هُدًۭى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ  
ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَـٰهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ

This is the Book! There is no doubt about it — a guide for those mindful of Allah  
Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and donate from what We have provided for them.

[Qur'an 2:2-3]

#### Explanation

The primary proposition is "This is the Book! There is no doubt about it." The logical branching is "a guide for those mindful of Allah" and the subsequent 3 verses which provide descriptions of "those mindful of Allah."

## Definition

A rhetorical device where the communicator subtly prepares the audience by providing preliminary hints, enabling them to anticipate the message before it is explicitly delivered.

## Example

كنت سعيدًا حقًا بنتائج هذا الامتحان. مبروك عليكم!  
لقد حصل كل منكم أكثر من ٩٥% درجة.

“I was really very happy with the results of this exam. Well done!  
All of you have scored more than 95%.”

#### Explanation

The teacher hints at the good marks prior to stating that everyone got more than 95%.

# CF-9: Anticipatory Closure

## Definition

A rhetorical device in which the speaker introduces an early phrase that guides or prepares the listener for the final word of a clause or rhyme of the verse, thus enhancing rhythmic harmony and closure. This rhetorical pre-emption or foreshadowing guides the listener's expectation.

## Examples
### Example 1

وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ الْغُرُوبِ.

And glorify the praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting.

[Qur'an 50:39]

#### Explanation

The phrase “قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ” sets up a rhythmic and thematic expectation, fulfilled by “قَبْلَ الْغُرُوبِ”.

### Example 2

وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيَظْلِمَهُمْ وَلَـٰكِن كَانُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ.

And Allah was not to wrong them, but they wronged themselves.

[Qur'an 29:40]

#### Explanation

The structure “وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيَظْلِمَهُمْ...” anticipates a contrastive resolution, which arrives with “...وَلَـٰكِن كَانُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ”.

## Definition

Rhetorical Shift, or Reference Switching is when the communicator changes between:

- Persons: first person, second person, third person
- Tenses: past tense, present tense, future, imperative
- Morphology: verb, active participle, passive participle
- Sentence type: verbal sentence, nominal sentence

This shift keeps the addressee engaged and provides stylistic diversity.

When the shift occurs between second and third person, it may overlap with [Apostrophe].

The term Rhetorical Shift may also apply to the use of a parenthetical aside for rhetorical purposes.

## Example

When Salim has lost his key:

سليم: أين مفتاحي؟ كان في جيبي. أين وضعت المفتاح يا سليم؟  
كيف يفقد الرجل مفتاح بيته؟ تعال يا سالم ... جد المفتاح بسرعة!

Salim: Where is my key? It was in my pocket. Where did you put the key, Salim? How does a man lose his house key? Come on Salim... find the key quickly!

#### Explanation

Salim refers to himself in the first person (“my key”), then the second person (“you”), and then the third person (“a man”). There are changes in verb from past tense (“was”), to present tense (“does”) to imperative (“find”).

_Also known as **Dialectical Mannerism**_
## Definition

The communicator uses reasoning, rational ideas, logic, or evidence to convince the addressee of the communicator’s proposition or to refute conflicting views. For rhetorical effect, the reasoning may be over-intricate, over-complex or argumentative. It may include repetition, warped logic, and surprising associations.

لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَا آلِهَةٌ إِلَّا اللَّهُ لَفَسَدَتَا

If there were in them (i.e. the heavens and the earth) gods besides Allah, they would both have been ruined.

_Also known as **Borrowing**_
## Definition

The communicator takes a well-known text such as a proverb, poem, story, prophetic sayings, or Quranic verse and inserts it into a new text. When the inserted text is a well-known poetic line or part of it, this is known as _taḍmīn_.

## Definition

The communicator incorporates a proverb, parable, or well-known statement into the text to strengthen the argument.

## Example

إذا جاء موسى وألقى العصا... فقد بطل السحر والساحر.

When Moses came and he threw down the stick... the magic and the magicians were defeated.

#### Explanation

This is a well-known proverb which refers to the story of Moses in Abrahamic texts, when he threw down his stick which became a snake that ate what Pharoah’s magicians were depicting as snakes. It alludes to the fact that truth will conquer falsehood. Incorporation of this proverb into a piece will strength its rhetorical strength.

## Example

كنت أنظر إلى الساعة طوال الليل، في انتظار الفجر المتأخر.

I was looking at the clock all night, waiting for the dawn.

## Definition

This is the abstracting of a general attribute from an individual, using an explicit abstraction formula: "In [the individual] I have [an abstracted trait]". For example: "In my neighbour, I have a true friend." The construct specifically includes prepositions like "li" (لـ) or "bi" (بـ) to indicate that an idealized trait or role exists within the subject.

## Example

فلئن بقيت لأحينّ لغزوةٍ نحو الغنائم أو يموتَ بي كريمٌ

Should I stay alive, I will embark on a raid... unless [in me] a noble man should die.

## Definition

The communicator exaggerates in describing a proposition.

## Types of hyperbole

There are three grades of hyperbole:

### Lowest (_tablīgh_)

The proposition is exaggerated but still commonly or customarily possible, and may normally occur.

هذه السيارة من أسرع السيارات التي يمكنك شراؤها بهذا السعر.

“This car is one of the fastest cars you can buy for this price.”

### Intermediate (_ighrāq_)

The proposition is conceptually possible but only hypothetically or rarely occurs.

هذه هي أسرع سيارة في العالم.

“This is the fastest car in the world.”

### Highest (_ghuluw_)

The proposition is conceptually impossible or beyond belief. In order for this level of exaggeration to be "acceptable", it needs to be done with poetic license, wit, satire, imagination, literary justification, or with a modifier like "almost".

يمكنك السفر بسرعة مليون ميل في الساعة في هذه السيارة!

“You’ll be travelling at a million miles an hour in this car!”

## Definition

The communicator denies the obvious cause of something happening, and instead proposes a different but fanciful cause. This has the effect of attributing the occurrence to something which benefits the communicator’s objectives and agenda.

## Example

لقد حققت النجاح بسبب دعاء والدتك الدائم لك فقط.

You achieved success only because of your mother’s constant supplication for you.

## Definition

A rhetorical device in which the speaker appears to concede to an opponent's accusation or argument, only to follow it with a justification, mitigating explanation, or rebuttal. The goal is often to soften opposition or redirect the audience's judgment.

## Example

كريم: هل أنفقت كل أموالنا؟  
سليم: نعم أنفقت كل المال. لكننا كنا جائعين أثناء الرحلة ولم يكن لدي خيار آخر.

Karim: Did you spend all our money?

## Definition

The communicator praises, then indicates that there is an exception to the praise, and then affirms the original praise by praising again. This is the opposite of [Affirmed Dispraise].

_Also known as **al-tashakkuk**_
## Definition

The communicator knows something but pretends not to know. This literary device may be found when the communicator wishes to express amazement, praise, dispraise, disapproval, or to reprimand, or create a sense of familiarity.

## Example

The communicator wishes to impart some advice about starting a company:

أتمنى أنني كنت أعرف هذا الأمر عندما أسست هذه الشركة قبل 10 سنوات.

“This is something I wish I knew when I started this company 10 years ago.”

#### Explanation

It is possible that the information was actually known when the company was started, but feigning ignorance has been used to setup a rhetorical image of ignorance which mirrors the addressee’s condition.

# CJ-6: Hemistich Ending Concordance
@canonical: https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/blob/v0.1.1/PDF/Arabic_Rhetorical_Devices/C-Linguistic_Embellishments_(ilm-ul-badi)/CJ-Rhythmic_Structuring_and_Balance/CJ-6_Hemistich_Ending_Concordance.pdf
## Definition

A rhetorical device in poetry where the final part of the first hemistich matches the final part of the second hemistich in meter, vowel, and rhyme. This produces a harmonious and balanced auditory effect. This technique is used to enhance musicality and symmetry.

When the rhyme between the two hemistichs occurs only in the first line of a poem (as is common in classical Arabic poetry), this is a separate prosodic device called taṣrī‘ which serves a formal role in setting the rhyme scheme. This is considered a prosodic convention, not a rhetorical figure.
